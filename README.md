# DISCLAIMER
This project is NOT dead. I have been working on a rewrite in Rust. It will recieve the update when I finish the copying files feature (in the Rust version). I'll make a commit to the dev branch today (4th of January 2023)

# LBS - LXD Build System
This is a project meant for making LXD "images". It's just an over-complicated shell script, but it has the basics of the Dockerfile syntax.
# Functions
Right now it supports:
- Making a container
- Choosing the base image
- Running commands in the container
- Building images
- Copying files from disk to container
# Stuff I'll add
- Volume management
- Some way to configure containers
